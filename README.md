This is a simple Flask application that returns the IP address of the client making the request. It includes rate limiting using Flask-Limiter to limit the number of requests per minute. It also supports different content types in the response based on the Accept header in the request. The application can be run as a Docker container and deployed to Kubernetes or Openshift. The Dockerfile includes multi-stage build to optimize the size of the image. The application also handles 404 and 500 errors with custom error pages.
